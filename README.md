## My google colab version
My idea was to create a google colab version of this app to use in my project that I made before. I was already using this application on my computer and it was slow and loaded my computer. So I decided to make a notepad in google colab to improve the performance.
You can find google colab notepad here: [link to colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/17dkYa5995yRVb75Mg8dWENZPoPSCZ52I)
